## shorten

The URL Shortener is a straightforward yet powerful API service created using Node.js and Express, designed to transform unwieldy, lengthy URLs into concise, manageable links. Its primary objective is to offer a user-friendly method for generating shortened URLs, making sharing and dissemination of web addresses more convenient. Furthermore, it seamlessly redirects users from the shortened version to the original long URL destination.

## Features

1. **Shorten URLs**: Create shorter versions of long URLs.
2. **Redirection**: Redirect users from the shortened URL to the original long URL.
3. **API Endpoint**: Provides an API endpoint to generate shortened URLs.

## How It Works

### 1. Shortening URL

To generate a shortened URL, issue a POST request to `v0/api/shorten` with a JSON payload containing the longUrl parameter. The service will respond with the generated short URL.

```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://example.com/very-long-url"}' http://shorten.fly.dev/v0/api/shorten
```

### 2. Accessing Shortened URL

Utilize the shortened URL generated by the service (`http://shorten.fly.dev/v0/api/shorten/:url_id`, where `:url_id` is the unique short ID) to seamlessly access the original long URL.
